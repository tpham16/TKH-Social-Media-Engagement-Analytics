The event was moderated by our Volunteer of the Month, Matthew Newton.\n\nAbout the panelists:\n\nDela Quist is founder and CIO of Alchemy Worx and Touchstone estimates he has already clocked up over 20,000 hours thinking about email. As an email marketer, Dela Quist is at the top of his field. But his professional attributes are by no means his only strengths; his personal ones are equally valuable. With everything that he does – from mentoring young marketers to sharing his expertise with seasoned professionals – his passion and love for seeing this industry grow and championing the people who make it up is evident. His personality – albeit, larger than life – only contributes to this, driving him to see the best in the projects he undertakes and the contributions he pushes into this field\nA popular international speaker on all matters email, his thought-provoking views and lively style regularly receive rave reviews. Says Loren Macdonald of EVAdoption “Dela always takes a contrarian view that gets the industry talking – and often gets the smartest email folks to rethink their views.” Dela served many years as a member of the UK DMA's Email Marketing Council, he also served on the executive management group of the IAB, and on the steering committee of Future of European Advertising Stakeholders (FAST).\n\nOpal Hoyt is a career technology producer who has been working in digital publishing, startups and advertising for the past 10 years. After graduating from Columbia University with a degree in Art History, she found that digital publishing was an apt cross between her art and technology interests. She began her career working as a strategic consultant for a startup incubator and since then has worked as a technical producer and project manager at places like Conde Nast, Spotify, The New York Times, Publicis, McCann and more. She has spent much  of this time freelancing and has most recently landed at Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) as a portfolio manager for technology &amp; digital collaboration on their Systems team.\nIn addition to work, Opal also spends free time working on her house in the West Catskills and writing/playing music with her band ZENIZEN.\n\nMatthew Newton is an Engineering Manager at Bloomberg, LP. Prior to that he worked at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY, where he was part of the team that developed the Blue Gene line of supercomputers. He has lived in Vietnam, Brazil, and Argentina, as well as four of the five boroughs. He has been a volunteer at The Knowledge House since 2018, a Board Member since 2019, and serves on the Development and Impact Committees. When not working or traveling internationally, he's usually occupied with entertaining his two young children, Elizabeth and Lucius.</span>",
