Many of the population, like Aaron Kaah, are bright and have full potential but lack the resources, opportunities, and exposure to gain entry into the growing tech sector. 

Over 50% of students who were admitted to our Fellowship programs did not have a laptop or wifi access to engage in our programming. What’s more, our students are in need of wraparound support, including mental health services, transportation, housing, and financial literacy, to help them persist and successfully graduate.  

How you can help:
  
With our current match opportunity of $250,000 from a generous donor, you can help secure half a million in funding to support our Fellows throughout their journey in 2023!  Your investment gives a Fellow access to instruction, career coaching, certifications, and the wraparound support they need to be successful.

The event was moderated by our Volunteer of the Month, Matthew Newton.

About the panelists:

Dela Quist is founder and CIO of Alchemy Worx and Touchstone estimates he has already clocked up over 20,000 hours thinking about email. As an email marketer, Dela Quist is at the top of his field. But his professional attributes are by no means his only strengths; his personal ones are equally valuable. With everything that he does – from mentoring young marketers to sharing his expertise with seasoned professionals – his passion and love for seeing this industry grow and championing the people who make it up is evident. His personality – albeit, larger than life – only contributes to this, driving him to see the best in the projects he undertakes and the contributions he pushes into this field
A popular international speaker on all matters email, his thought-provoking views and lively style regularly receive rave reviews. Says Loren Macdonald of EVAdoption “Dela always takes a contrarian view that gets the industry talking – and often gets the smartest email folks to rethink their views.” Dela served many years as a member of the UK DMA's Email Marketing Council, he also served on the executive management group of the IAB, and on the steering committee of Future of European Advertising Stakeholders (FAST).

Opal Hoyt is a career technology producer who has been working in digital publishing, startups and advertising for the past 10 years. After graduating from Columbia University with a degree in Art History, she found that digital publishing was an apt cross between her art and technology interests. She began her career working as a strategic consultant for a startup incubator and since then has worked as a technical producer and project manager at places like Conde Nast, Spotify, The New York Times, Publicis, McCann and more. She has spent much  of this time freelancing and has most recently landed at Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) as a portfolio manager for technology &amp; digital collaboration on their Systems team.
In addition to work, Opal also spends free time working on her house in the West Catskills and writing/playing music with her band ZENIZEN.

Matthew Newton is an Engineering Manager at Bloomberg, LP. Prior to that he worked at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY, where he was part of the team that developed the Blue Gene line of supercomputers. He has lived in Vietnam, Brazil, and Argentina, as well as four of the five boroughs. He has been a volunteer at The Knowledge House since 2018, a Board Member since 2019, and serves on the Development and Impact Committees. When not working or traveling internationally, he's usually occupied with entertaining his two young children, Elizabeth and Lucius.</span>","Join us in conversation with two of TKH's Fellows, Quiana Berry and Ayman Omer, as they speak about the impact of TKH with industry professionals, Opal Hoyt and Dela Quist.
