## Results 
This project web-scraped Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube data from The Knowledge House using Snscrape and Apify. The collected data offers valuable insights and recommendations for enhancing social media engagement. 

### Best Time to Post
* Analysis of the collected data indicated that Twitter and Instagram posts posted between 6-7 PM (EST) resulted in the highest amount of likes. Additionally, the trends in engagement revealed that all of the platforms received the most amount of likes during the months of May, June, and March.

### Most Effective Posts
* According to Instagram data, Instagram carousels or sidecars, which may feature a mix of up to 10 photos or videos, posts received the most engagement in likes and comments. Top performing Instagram hashtags were: expand opportunity, tech, and Atlanta. The top three liked YouTube videos were The Knowledge House 2020 Innovation Fellows, The Knowledge House 2020 Innovation Fellowship, and A Day in The Life: UXUI & Web Development. According to the collected data, YouTube videos that were less than a minute received the most amount of likes. The top tweet celebrated Kimberly Bryant, the CEO of Black Girls Code. 

### Most Effective Social Social Media Platforms 
* Analysis of the collected data showed that Instagram was the most effective platform for THe Knowledge House in terms of engagement. This may suggest that The Knowledge House should prioritize its efforts on Instagram to maximize social media engagement. 

### Content Generating the Most Engagement
* The data analysis revealed that posts containing educational content, such as expanding opportunities and success stories, generated the highest level of engagement across all three platforms. Users showed a strong interest in educational content related to technology, coding, and career development. Additionally, posts featuring visuals such as images and videos garnered increased likes, comments, and shares. It is recommended that The Knowledge House continues to share educational content in the form of sidecars and short-minute videos. 

## Next Actions 
* Based on these findings, The Knowledge House should continue to maintain consistent and frequent posting schedules on all platforms to keep the audience engaged. Additionally, engagement with followers by responding to comments, direct messages, and mentions may encourage further engagement. The next actions for this project may feature analysis on platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook. Further analysis of the metrics such as reach, impressions, engagement rate, and follower growth would provide more insight into the growth of each respective platform.
